Feature selection:


-Features that have a correlation coefficient greater than .4 or less than -.4 with Saleprices (target)

-All categorical features were initially one-hot-encoded. Then a correlation coeffcient between each column and salesprice was computed. If any value in a given column 
scored greater than .4 or less than -.4 i included the column in the baseline model

GarageYrBlt replaced with median 

MasVnrArea replaced with mode 
BsmtFinType1 replaced with mode 
GarageFinish replaced with mode 
BsmtQual replaced with mode 



Categorical Encoding: 


Neighborhood: Target Mean Encoding 
BsmtFinType1: Target Mean Encoding 


For ExterQual, KithcenQual, and BsmtQual, i began in each column by grouping the houses by the four distinct values in the column, then computing the average salesprice for each group. 
The results for each column were then averaged amongest themselves. Using these newly calculated cumulative salesprice averages, i averaged the salesprice of each of the three quality features 
based on the values corresponding average salesprice 

Foundation: Target Mean Encoding 
GarageFinish: Target Mean Encoding
